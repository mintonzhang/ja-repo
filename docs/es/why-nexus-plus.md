# Why We Built nexus-plus To Replace Nexus

nexus-plus was not created because we wanted to rebuild an artifact repository for its own sake. It was created because our existing Nexus deployment could no longer meet our scale requirements for stability, upgrades, cost, and migration effort.

## The Incident That Started It

We had long been using Nexus Repository `3.29.2-02`. It was deployed in Kubernetes, with ESSD mounted as a local disk, and metadata still depended on Nexus's OrientDB at that time.

Back in 2023, we only adjusted a JVM memory setting and restarted the service, but that triggered OrientDB file corruption. Nexus then completely crashed and could not be brought up, directly affecting production build and release for all business lines.

That incident took about one day to recover. While investigating OrientDB-related errors online, we found that many similar reports came from Nexus operations scenarios. For us, this was not an ordinary incident. It was a clear signal: once an artifact repository becomes core CI/CD infrastructure for the whole company, embedded databases and local filesystem state become high-risk architecture choices.

## Scale Changed

By 2026, our Nexus usage had grown to another level, and our requirements for stability, scalability, and operability had also increased.

We needed:

- Multi-replica deployment and rolling upgrades.
- Core state stored in an external database that can be governed, backed up, and restored.
- Blob data stored in object storage such as OSS/S3.
- Fast failover and recovery during incidents, instead of relying on a single local data directory.
- Client protocols, URLs, and permission/authentication model kept as compatible with Nexus as possible.

The natural first reaction was to upgrade Nexus.

## The Reality Of Upgrades And Commercial Editions

After deploying a newer version, we found that the new Nexus Community Edition was not friendly to our scale.

According to Sonatype official documentation, Nexus Repository Community Edition is intended for individuals and small teams, supports up to `40,000` components and `100,000` requests per day. Sonatype's official pricing page lists Nexus Repository Pro Edition starting at `$1,620 / year + consumption`; larger scale or special deployment models require separate commercial discussion.

Public discussion in Sonatype's `nexus-public` repository reflects a similar concern. In [Issue #883](https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-public/issues/883), a user reported that after upgrading to `3.87.0`, Community Edition component and request limits had been reduced, then asked whether those limits might continue changing in later releases. For us, this kind of public feedback means the Community Edition boundary is not only about the current quota, but also about uncertainty for future upgrades and capacity planning.

We are willing to pay for infrastructure software, but at our artifact scale and traffic scale, the new Community Edition limits do not apply to us, and the commercial edition price and purchasing uncertainty exceeded expectations.

This means continuing along the Nexus upgrade path does not solve the problems we actually care about at low cost:

- OrientDB stability risk in old versions.
- Usage limits in newer Community Edition versions.
- Commercial cost and scale pricing uncertainty of the Pro version.
- Migration, verification, and rollback risk when upgrading from an old version to a new architecture.

## Why Not Use An Existing Alternative Directly

We also seriously evaluated other artifact repository solutions, but did not find one suitable enough.

The real cost is not just "deploying a new service"; it is a company-wide migration:

- Server operations engineers need to migrate all historical data to the new platform.
- Users, roles, permissions, tokens, repository configuration, and blob data need to be maintained again.
- Users need to modify CI, build scripts, Maven settings, npm registry, PyPI index-url, Go proxy, Helm repo, and similar configuration one by one.
- In a large company, this kind of change affects many business lines, build tasks, and release flows.

If an alternative cannot stay compatible with Nexus's `/repository/<repo>/...` URL layout, client protocols, and permission/authentication model, migration cost becomes very high and transparent cutover becomes difficult.

## Why We Chose To Build nexus-plus

With AI coding assistants available today, we chose to solve the problem ourselves.

The core ideas of nexus-plus are:

- Compatible with Nexus client protocol behavior.
- Compatible with Nexus's `/repository/<repo>/...` URL layout.
- Compatible with Nexus's permission/authentication model.
- Use MySQL to store metadata, permissions, tokens, audit logs, migration state, and cross-replica coordination state.
- Use OSS/S3 to store artifact blobs.
- Do not depend on OrientDB, embedded Elasticsearch, or a local persistent blob filesystem.
- Support migration from existing Nexus instances to nexus-plus, making the migration as transparent as possible to users.

This project was born with the help of AI. The main code was completed by AI in about one week. Humans mainly handled product goals, architecture constraints, compatibility requirements, issue diagnosis, and a small amount of code review.

To control the risk of this development approach, we did not rely on the subjective judgment that "it looks implemented." Instead, we put correctness behind black-box tests and real traffic validation:

- The project includes an independent `compat-test` module for black-box compatibility tests against real Nexus reference instances.
- After migrating Nexus to nexus-plus, we mirrored 100% of real production traffic to nexus-plus through Istio and observed response status, errors, latency, and protocol behavior.
- Features, protocols, and boundary cases are covered as much as possible by black-box tests, mirrored traffic, and production metrics.

Thanks to Codex and Claude. Without AI, we would not have chosen this way to solve the problem.

## Migration Result

We have now migrated from Nexus to nexus-plus with zero downtime.

After migration:

- The original Nexus domain points to nexus-plus.
- Client configuration does not need to change.
- CI continues to use the original Maven settings, npm registry, PyPI index-url, Go proxy, and Helm repo.
- Users did not perceive the migration process.
- No business-side failure feedback was received after migration.

More importantly, after migration we gained operational capabilities that were previously difficult to have:

- Rolling upgrades.
- Scaling to multiple instances.
- Automatic elastic scaling.
- Core state in MySQL, which is easier to back up, troubleshoot, and restore.
- Blob data in OSS/S3, no longer tied to a single local data directory.

This is the starting point of nexus-plus: not to build a more complex Nexus, but to replace the old Nexus that had become a stability risk at our scale with a simpler, controllable, and recoverable architecture.

## Why Open Source

We chose to open source nexus-plus because we hope teams facing similar problems can have one more open source option.

If you are also using an old Nexus version and facing embedded database stability problems, upgrade-path problems, Community Edition usage limits, Pro version cost, migration workload, or insufficient multi-replica deployment capability, nexus-plus aims to provide a smoother alternative path.

The larger hope is that this project can continue growing in the open source community: keep improving Nexus compatibility, continuously strengthen migration and operations capabilities, and expand support for more artifact repository formats through community feedback and contributions.
