## Compatibility and design checklist

- [ ] Protocol behavior changes were compared with the official protocol and Nexus behavior, or this PR does not change protocol behavior.
- [ ] Protocol behavior changes include or update compatibility tests under `compat-test`, or the reason is explained.
- [ ] State, cache, locking, session, background task, upload/delete, metadata, and permission changes describe their multi-replica behavior, or this PR does not touch those areas.
- [ ] Migration changes are idempotent and consider dry-run, resume, checksum validation, and reporting, or this PR does not touch migration.
